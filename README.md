# TridentDuper
1.21.4 mod (patched on paper servers) can dupe tridents

completely charge back a trident
press the V key (changeable in settings). This will throw the trident and also move the trident in your 2x2 crafting grid in inventory
pick up the thrown trident, and bring the trident from 2x2 crafting to invnetory, you now have 2 tridents!

this is purely fabric mod, i made it because the one i found required meteor lol

also the code just says Fletching Table because i was about to make a fletching table mod but then used the workspace for this lmao
